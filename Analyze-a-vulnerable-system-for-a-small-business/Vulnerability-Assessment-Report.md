# Scenario

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

# Vulnerability Assessment Report
#### 26th November 2025

## System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from November 2025 to January 2026. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose
The database server is a critical asset for the company, as it stores essential information about potential customers and business operations. Protecting this data is fundamental to ensuring business continuity, complying with privacy regulations, and maintaining user trust. The public exposure of the server represents a direct threat to the integrity and confidentiality of the information. An unexpected shutdown or a successful attack could disrupt key processes, generate financial losses, and damage corporate reputation. Therefore, this assessment is conducted to identify risks and propose mitigation measures.

## Risk Assessment Table

| Threat Source       | Event                                      | Probability | Severity | Risk (P×S) |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Competitor          | Exfiltration of sensitive information       | 1           | 3        | 3 (Low)    |
| External Hacker     | Denial of Service (DoS) attack to disrupt operations | 2           | 3        | 6 (Moderate) |
| Careless Employee   | Accidental deletion of critical data        | 2           | 2        | 4 (Moderate) |

## Approach
The risk assessment considered the company’s current methods of data storage and management. The likelihood of potential threat occurrences and the severity of their impact were evaluated against the organization’s daily operational requirements. This approach ensures that identified risks are not only analyzed in terms of technical vulnerabilities but also in relation to their potential disruption of business continuity and critical processes. By weighing probability and impact, the assessment provides a balanced view that supports informed decision-making and prioritization of remediation efforts.

## Remediation Strategy
The remediation strategy focuses on strengthening access controls and securing data transmission to protect the database server. Authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms must be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access the system. This includes enforcing strong password policies, applying role-based access controls, and enabling multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Data in motion should be encrypted using TLS instead of SSL to guarantee secure communication. Additionally, IP allow-listing should be configured to restrict access exclusively to corporate offices, preventing unauthorized connections from random internet users.
