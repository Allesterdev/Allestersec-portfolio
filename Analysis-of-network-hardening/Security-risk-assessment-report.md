# Scenario

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

 1. The organization’s employees' share passwords.

 2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.

 3. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.

 4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.

### Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement
The tools that should be used to harden security and patch vulnerabilities include: Password Policies, Firewall Maintenance, and Multi-Factor Authentication.

### Part 2: Explain your recommendations
With Password Policies, each employee would have their own unique password. These passwords would be more complex and required to be changed periodically. This would make it more difficult for malicious actors to guess credentials or use brute-force attacks.

With Firewall Maintenance, the security configuration would be updated to be more restrictive, thereby providing stronger protection against attacks such as DDoS.

With Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), employees would be required to provide multiple forms of identification. For example, a one-time password, biometric verification, or other factors could be required to strengthen authentication. This would further reinforce the security system against brute-force and similar attacks.
